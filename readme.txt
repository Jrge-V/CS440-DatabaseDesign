5. List the other users who are favorited by both users X, and Y. Usernames X and Y will be
selected from dropdown menus by the instructor. In other words, the user (or users) C are the
favorite for both X and Y.

6. Display all the users who never posted any "excellent" items: an item is excellent if at least
three reviews are excellent.

7. Display all the users who never posted a "poor" review.

8. Display all the users who posted some reviews, but each of them is "poor".

9. Display those users such that each item they posted so far never received any "poor" reviews.
In other words, these users must have posted some items; however, these items have never
received any poor reviews or have not received any reviews at all.

10. List a user pair (A, B) such that they always gave each other "excellent" reviews for every single
item they posted.
